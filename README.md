# Work has BEGUN!!!
I've started working on my new blog site.
Keep up with the progress on this repo.

# Tech?
Yep, I got some cool tech here
- Svelte
- Three.js
- Pocketbase backend
- Azure VM to host it all

# Future Additions?
I want to add 2 things.
1. The Lab, a testing place for all my web based experiments, and also possibly open it up to other developers to host their things on my site to show off their work as well.
2. I'm considering making an integration with Manabox, to show my MTG collection on my site, and be able to sell cards from my site.
