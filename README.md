# Well, Here we go again
Updating the blog site... again...

This time, I'm gonna make it more like a portfolio. Probably won't even have a backend lol

## Ideas
- Space themed 3D background, that moves as you scroll. I'm thinking a spaceship that lifts off Earth, does an orbit or two, flies off into hyperspace, and then comes out at a space station that it docks with, and then inside that station is a bunch of my acheivements/things I'd like to show off. Through out it, I'd like to put space billboards that have actuall admob ads on them, cause I think it'd be cool.
- Thats basically it. I really want to make something with three.js, and this just seems like a great way to do it.
